Environment setup
Install docker-compose:

sudo -H pip3 install docker-compose
Careful! Read the note about keyfile first.

Run:

docker-compose build 
The above command will build your container.

Create the file in the project root dir:

docker-compose-prod.yaml
Add following content to it

version: '2'
services:
  app-api:
    environment:
      - INFURA_URL=
      - KEYFILE=
      - PASSWORD=
      - CHAIN_ID=
      - ACCOUNT=
      - SSH_USERNAME=
      - SSH_PASSWORD=
      - UBITQUITY_HOST=[AVAILABLE FOR LICENSED CUSTOMERS ON SECURE CUSTOM HOSTED INSTANCES]
      - UBITQUITY_FILE_PATH=/var/www/html/deeds/[COMPANY DIRECTORY]
Fill the empty settings with proper values (this is extremely important). The UBITQUITY_ prefixed environment variables can be as they are.

Note: keyfile

Keyfile is private at should be known only to the owner. This is not included in the repository. When you create your geth account (on
rinkeby on any other network) – after listing the accounts you can see the key file path. Copy this key to the root folder of the
application and run docker-compose build, later on add env variable with PATH as follows: KEYFILE=/app/UTC–2018-09-06T16-44-51….

!IMPORTANT, be very careful with the key and working with version control system (git) and never push your key to the repository.

After settings all of the variables, run:

> docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-prod.yaml up -d
You are ready to go! Go to the browser and type: <host_ip>:8080/

*** Entering Docker Container ***

To enter the docker container run:

docker-compose exec app-api bash
To switch between Testnet in Docker to Production (“mainnet”)
in the root dir you have:

docker-composer-prod.yaml```
docker-composer-prod.yaml -> testnet settings
docker-compose-prod-settings.yaml -> prod settings

now you need to run two commands:
```sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-prod.yaml stop```

This will stop the current service, and:

```sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose-prod-settings.yaml up -d```

... and vice-versa. You can simply switch to testnet with mainnet.
